*In this activity you will explore the populations of seals overtime.*

## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.178573/GIS_species_data.zip which describes the population density of seals over time in the Kara Sea, Barents Sea, and Franz Josef Land of Northern Siberia.

## Q1: How do seal populations over time compare in each zone?

*Interpretation*: In this data we can see three different zones: Barents Sea, Franz Josef Land, and the Kara Sea. Because each zone is indicated by a color, you can visually see that the Kara Sea represents a large portion of the seal populations counted. Second to Kara Sea is the Barents Sea. The zone with the smallest seal population is Franz Josef Land. 

## Q2: Are seal populations increasing or decreasing over time?

*Interpretation*: The data shows that seal populations seem to fluctuate over time. The 'Number of Seals' indicates the average number of seals counted in one day. In 1998, scientists were able to daily count 2.5 seals on average. In 2002, this average rises to almost 5 seals per day. In between the spikes of 'Number of Seals' in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2005, there are declines in seal counts. In 2003, the average daily count for seals was 1 and at its lowest.

## Q3: When do seal populations increase throughout the year?

*Interpretation*: The data show that each year on average has a spike in seal counts in the third month. This means that in March you are more likely to see seals in these zones. Populations are also at their lowest in the first month of the year.
