# Data Summary by A. Ewing

## Overview of Data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.182697/Data-set%20Mate-copying%20of%20a%20costly%20variant%20.xlsx which describes Drosophila mating preferences between wild-type and Curly mutant flies when they are observing mating occurring between two flies before they mate themselves. The researchers wanted to know if the females would copy the behavior they observed even if it meant mating with a mutant, in this case, the Curly mutant.

## Q1: Do female Drosophila naturally prefer mating with wild-type or Curly mutant flies?
