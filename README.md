# Data Interpretation Project

## Overview
You have gained a lot of skills so far in this class, ranging from file manipulation in `bash`, submitting jobs to the clusters, filtering data with `data.table` and plotting data with `ggplot`. In this final project, you will select, analyze, plot, and publish your workflow/interpretation.

You will be able to choose a data set that interests you, and then create three plots to address different questions related to the data. You will publish your work via a GitHub repository that contains your code, describes the questions you sought to answer, and shows the plots & your interpretations. **Each person at a table should use a different data set**, though it is fine to assist each other with technical/coding issues.

You will have both this week and the following class time (April 15 and April 22) to work on and polish your project, ask for assistance, and prepare to share your results with the class (on the last day, April 29) in a very brief (~2 minute) presentation.

## Example Data Sets

There are loads of published data sets available on the internet. You're free to use any of the examples below, or [search for any topic of interest](https://datadryad.org/discover?query=&submit=Search#advanced).

[Mean phenotype values for various DGRP (drosophila melanogaster) lines](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.js408/5)

[Heat tolerance for different species of Crustacean](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.tf641/1)

Survival and life history data for [low-altitude](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3gc6nj6/1) and [high-altitude](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3gc6nj6/2) Arabidopsis thaliana

[C. elegans fecundity, size at 72h and 144h old, and survival within three treatments](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.7g5qh/1)

Note: On datadryad, you can get a direct link to download (for example via wget in bash) from the *View/Open* link -- just remove the `?sequence=1` portion.


## Working with GitHub
GitHub is a popular website for storing code history and publishing work for others to see. Thus far, you've simply used `git clone` to retrieve a repository that already exists. For this project, you'll be uploading your workflow as well.

You will *fork* the `BIOL4585_projects` repository. A *fork* is a copy where you can make make changes without worrying about your changes influencing the original project.

1. Create a GitHub account (or log in to an existing account) for your personal use at https://github.com/

2. **Fork** the `BIOL4585_projects` repository by navigating to https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects in your browser and clicking *Fork* in the top right. This will create a copy of the repository for your own use.

3. **Clone** the repository in bash after navigating to `/scratch/$USER/` on Rivanna. This is where you will do your work. Get the clone URL by navigating to your forked repository within a web browser, and click the green **Clone or download** button. Make sure you're cloning with `HTTPS`, then copy the URL in the popup text box. `cd` to `/scratch/$USER` then execute `git clone https://github.com/**YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE**/BIOL4585_projects.git`

4. `cd` into the `BIOL4585_projects` directory, and then create your own personal folder. Your own folder can be named your computing ID, or your last name, or something like that. The reason we want a unique folder for you is because after we merge the whole class's projects together in one repository, we want each person to have their own work still separate. For example, I created a folder `caw5cv` and did my work in that folder.

5. Get to work downloading and processing your data! You'll want to keep track of all commands you use so the whole workflow is 100% reproducible for someone unfamiliar to the project. It is helpful to add comments to your bash and R code by starting lines with the `#` character.

6. You can save your plots from `ggplot` using the `ggsave()` command. See `?ggsave` for more detail on how to use it.

7. Create a file named `README.md` within your personal folder inside `BIOL4585_projects`. This file will contain GitHub Markdown text describing your workflow and display your plots. (FYI, this page you're reading is written in GitHub Markdown!) A final submission will look something like the [example I added here](https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects/tree/master/caw5cv) and you're free to copy/edit my example as a template.

8. Complete the Data Camp chapter 1 [*Basic Workflow*](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science) of the course *Introduction to Git for Data Science*

9. Publish your repository by pushing your changes to your GitHub repository, then submitting a *pull request* on the [original repository](https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects) (see below for more detail).

## Checklist of project requirements
Prior to submitting your pull request, make sure you've fulfilled the following criteria:

1. Your repository should include the data (file) you analyzed, and a text file describing how you retrieved it and plotted it. Your work flow text file should be understandable and contain comments to guide the reader through the workflow.

2. Your repository should contain (at least) three quality plots that you generated with ggplot, with clean axis, title, and legend labels.

3. Your repository should contain a `README.md` file written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) describing your work. See my [example](https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects/tree/master/caw5cv)

## Sharing your work via a *pull request*
Briefly, you will use `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to add your changes to the GitHub repository online, then submit a *pull request* to propose merging your changes. These terms may sound confusing for now, and that's fine. You first add all of your changes (while inside the repository) with  `git add -A .`, then *commit* those changes using `git commit -m "add files"`, and *push* those changes to GitHub using `git push origin master`. You can then propose your changes be merged into the original repository by navigating [here](https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects) and clicking *New pull request*. See [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for more detail.

```
# Example flow for pushing your changes to your GitHub account

# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /scratch/$USER/BIOL4585_projects

# Add all files for preparing to push them
git add -A .

# commit the changes with a log message. You can include any message you want, here it's "add files"
git commit -m "add files"

# push the changes to your GitHub repository 'in the cloud'
git push origin master

# Next step: Navigate to https://github.com/cory-weller/BIOL4585_projects and submit a pull request
```
