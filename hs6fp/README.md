# H. Stone's Ostrich Movement Analysis
## Introduction
The data I used is from [this source](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.h846r). The data provides physical measurements of seven different ostriches and recordings about their movements while walking or running.
## Does an ostrich's hip height predict its mass?

**Figure 1.** *For the sample of seven ostriches, mass increases as hip height increases. This makes sense because a taller ostrich probably weighs more.*
## Do ostriches' step lengths predict their step frequency, and does this relationship vary by gait?

**Figure 2.** *Distributions appear to be fairly similar for each ostrich, although ostrich 5 seems to have had less frequent steps when running for some of the trials. When running, step frequency increases as step length increases. However, there does not appear to be much of a relationship between frequency and length when walking. Overall, walking steps are both less frequent and shorter. Running steps have a greater range of values for frequency and length. From this data, we can hypothesize that an ostrich tends to have one general walking pace, while an ostrich may have a greater range of running paces. This makes sense because if an ostrich wanted to go fast, he or she would probably just break into a run.*
## Does hip height predict average speed of ostriches?

**Figure 3.** *Hip height does not appear to correlate with average walking speed for each ostrich. However, as hip height increases, there is a slight increase in average running speed. Given the data in Plot 2, this makes some sense because ostriches don't seem to max out on speed when walking. However, they do show ranges in speed when running, which suggests that longer legs may improve running speed.*
