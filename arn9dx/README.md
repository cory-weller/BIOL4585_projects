## **Data Summary**
# **by: Ally Nigro**


## **Overview of Data**

I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.78937/Lines_data.csvm which describes the fecundity, survival, and size at both 72 and 144 hours of C. Elegans in differing environmental conditions

The data was reported on 14 different lines of C. Elegans

# **Q1: Does Environment correlate with Fecundity?**


The data presented in this graph show that there are discrepancies in fecundity between the different environments, with the control environment having the highest fecundity, followed by the uranium, then the salt environment.

# **Q2: Does the environment have an effect on the relationship between length (at 72 or 144 hours) and fecundity?**

The data presented in these graphs show nearly identical relationships. The relationship shown indicates that there is a correlation between the environment and the length of the organism. It is clear that the control environment provides the greatest opportunity for growth and that as length increases so does fecundity of the organism. These graphs insinuate somewhat of a negative effect of the uranium and the salt environment on both fecundity and growth/length.

# **Q3: Do the Different lines of C. Elegans show differences in their fecundity?** *(shown as a function of environment and without the environmental coding)*

These plots are meant to show the  relationship between the differing fecundity of C. Elegans lines, while plot 4 shows additional information regarding the environment of the organism. These data show that some lines have a higher overall fecundity than others, the notable differences being in lines 3, 4, and 7. Another correlation that can be ascertained from this graph is the relationship seen in other graphs between environment and fecundity. Plot 4 provides information about this relationship not shown in the other graphs being that it illustrates the range of fecundity differences for each environmental condition and even point to outliers that are skewing said data.
