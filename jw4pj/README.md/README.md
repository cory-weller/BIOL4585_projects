# Data summary by Jack Winterhalter


## Overview of data
I used data from https://link/to/data/download.csv which describes the fecundity, size at 72h and 144h old, and survival of C. elegans within three different environmental treatments.

## Q1: Is there a correlation between fecundity and environment?

*Interpretation*: The data show significant differences between the fecundity of the control group and the fecundity of the salt and uranium treatments. The control group clearly had the highest fecundity, followed by the uranium treatment and then the salt treatment which had the lowest fecundity.  

## Q2: Does length at different time points correlate with fecundity?

![Length vs Fecundity at 144h](/BIOL4585_projects/jw4pj/lengthVSfecundity144.png)


*Interpretation*:In general, there is a positive relationship between length and fecundity as shown by these graphs. The organisms that are growing to be the longest also have higher levels of fecundity. This trend also holds within each environmental treatment, as highlighted by the trendlines. Furthermore, there is a clear divide between treatments, with the control group having the most growth, followed by the uranium group and then the salt group with the least growth. All of these patterns are consistent over both 72 and 144 hours. 

## Q3: How does length vary over different time points for the different treatments?

*Interpretation*: The data in this plot shows more clearly how length is changing over time in the different groups.The violin plot makes it easier to see roughly how many organisms in each group were of a certain length. The largest increase in length is seen in the control group, with the uranium group also increasing. The salt group is more unique because although there were clearly some organisms that did increase in length, there was also a large number that showed little or no change in length, which is why the plot at the 144 hour point is more narrow.
